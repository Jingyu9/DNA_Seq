##After manipulating the **Contig_vs_Virus_tblastx_results_2.THREADED** file in Excel, it is loaded to Access database called "Simplified_tblastx_Result"
##SCN_gDNA_Contigs (assembled before mapping to viral genomes) was also load to Access database

##Based on the ContigID, the relationship was built between the above two tables.

There are **482** uniq contigs showing high similarity (Evalue < E-10) with viral genomes by tblastx

There are **5** contigs (longer than 1000bp) from SCN_gDNA_Contigs table showed high similarity with nudivirus by tblastx
